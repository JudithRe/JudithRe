# Hello,I'm Judith ☺️

## About Me
After years of specialising in languages, literature and marketing. I am currently learning how to code. 

I enjoy creating websites and landing pages and seeing how a first idea develops into a finished project. As I have a background in content and search engine optimisation, I am so far most familiar with frontend design using HTML, CSS and (some) Javascript.

- 😃 I like to read, game and spend time outside 
- 🌱 I'm currently studying web development and Japanese.
